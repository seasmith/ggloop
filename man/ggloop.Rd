\usage{
ggloop(data, mappings = aes_loop(), remap_xy = TRUE, remap_dots = FALSE,
  environment = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Default dataset to use for plot. Must be a data frame and can be
only one data frame.}

\item{mappings}{Default list of aesthetic mappings to use for plots.}

\item{remap_xy}{Remapping behavior of \code{x} and \code{y} vectors specified
in \code{aes_loop()}.}

\item{remap_dots}{Remapping behavior of \code{...} vectors specified in
\code{aes_loop()}.}

\item{environment}{An environment and only one environment (cannot be a
vector). If a variable defined in the aesthetic mapping is not found in the
data, \code{ggplot()} (called inside \code{ggloop()}) will look for it in
this environment. It defaults to using the environment in which
\code{ggloop()} was called.}
}
\details{
\code{ggloop()} makes use of the first of two \code{aes_loop}
functions. \code{aes_loop()} is meant to mimic \code{aes} from
\code{ggplot2}, and because of this, the remapping behavior of the aesthetics
is controlled by the remapping arguments supplied to \code{ggloop()}.

The first remapping argument, \code{remap_xy} can take three values:
\itemize{ \item \code{TRUE} = The default behavior. All unqiue combinations
of \code{x} and \code{y} are generated. This means that if a variable (i.e.
\code{mpg}) is supplied in both \code{x} and \code{y}, then no mapping will
have \code{x} and \code{y} variables that are the same (i.e. \code{x -> mpg;
y -> mpg} will not ever happen). Likewise, no unordered pair duplicates will
happen (i.e. \code{x -> mpg; y -> cyl} and \code{x -> cyl; y -> mpg} will be
treated the same). \item \code{FALSE} = If \code{x} and \code{y} vectors are
not the same length, then the shorter of the two will be recycled. Recycling
is similar to \code{mapply()}'s recycling. \item \code{NA} = If \code{x} and
\code{y} vectors are not the same length, then the shorter of the two will
have \code{NA} assigned to the missing elements. These are meant to act as
placeholders during the wrangling operations (extracting and grouping the
aesthetics), and will be taken out before the final list of mappings is sent
to \code{ggloop()}. }
