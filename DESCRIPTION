Description: Pass a data frame and mapping aesthetics to ggloop() in order
    to create a list of ggplot object for the specified remapping of aesthetics.
    Pass x, y, and ... aesthetics to ggloop() as you would with ggplot(). You
    can add geoms, themes, facets, and other features to these objects with the
    special %L+% (L-plus) operator.
